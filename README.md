The MoneyBird-python client at https://github.com/jjkester/moneybird-python is no longer maintained (archived). 
The code in the Fork here is maintained by me for the time being.
If time permits I may become maintainer.
As long as there is no maintainer for the package at PyPi we remain doing it here.

This code includes the following fixes on top of the latest/last jjkester/moneybird-python 

* 204 HTTP return code on `delete` 
* tests for the new 2021 MB API for new Contacts structure.
* enhancements from  https://github.com/VictorGerritsen/moneybird-python: allow query and attachments in `post`
